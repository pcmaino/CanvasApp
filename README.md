CanvasApp

Goals:
This application is intented to allow the user to place two balls on screen, a red and blue ball, and then graph a line between them.
It could then display the equation of that line, and eventually maybe have support for non linear lines. This application could be used
as a sort of education tool in children's mathematics classes.




Progress:
